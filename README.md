# Chrome Dashboard replacement for developers

This project is my submission for the final Pset in Harvard's CS50x

The main inpiration for this project is to append commonly used keywords to search terms. Between every day development projects and learning new languages and frameworks I, like many, find myself prefacing my searches with the name of the framework or language when searching online. I began to think that it would be nice if i could just search for the specifics and have the search engine append the language/framework that I am interested in searching.

### Features currently in developement.

- dropdown menu populated with customizable keywords
- ability to change the selected keyword by begining to type the word and hitting tab to autocomple and switch keyword (to mimic bash autocomplete)
- buttons to search multiple search engines
- press enter to search default search engine (customizable)

### Dashboard features

- local weather 
- note space
- quick links (user defined bookmarks)
- clock
- unsplash background
